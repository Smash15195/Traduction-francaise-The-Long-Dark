The Long Dark is a post-disaster survival simulation. Although we strive to provide an experience steeped in realism, the game is not a replacement for proper wilderness survival training.

***
As the result of the geomagnetic disaster which serves as part of the fictional foundation of the game, we have taken liberties with the portrayal of wildlife behaviour.

- William Golding, Lord of the Flies",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteHeller,"“He is at home with his solitude as the note reverberating inside a bell.” 

- Peter Heller, The Dog Stars",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteKing,"""No one can tell what goes on between the person you were and the person you become. No one can chart that blue and lonely section of hell. There are no maps of the change. You just come out the other side."" 

- Stephen King, The Stand",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteMamet,"“You know, I once read an interesting book which said that, uh, most people lost in the wilds, they, they die of shame. Yeah, see, they die of shame. 'What did I do wrong? How could I have gotten myself into this?' And so they sit there and they... die. Because they didn't do the one thing that would save their lives. Thinking.” 

- David Mamet, The Edge",,

- Richard Matheson, I Am Legend",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteMcCarthy,"“No lists of things to be done. The day providential to itself. The hour. There is no later. This is later. All things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one's heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes.”

- Seneca",,
GAMEPLAY_QuoteThoreau,"""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.""
